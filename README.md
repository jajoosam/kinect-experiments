`music-visualizer.pde` takes an audio stream from the microphone, and uses `minim` to detect beat onsets - which generate a new color for the dancer's image to change to, along with a cool glitch effect.

To take a stream of high quality music playing on the same computer, use [Soundflower](https://rogueamoeba.com/freebies/soundflower/) for mac - which generates a virtual micrphone.
